# handoff

#### *a virtual interaction to create sufficient knowledge.*

What i'm trying to do with this one is create a programmatic model of a cellular wall's scaffold protien. To me it 
represents a **hand off**, and this is my colloquilism for knowledge transfer. It's passive as %&#^!, and chroincally 
nonetheless, but it's providing sufficient knowledge to all parties (i'll term `agents` in 
[battlement](https://github.com/white5moke/battlement)).

#### what can it do?

````
bye  : exit the app.

cur  : what is your current key document

del  : deletes all your key documents. DON'T PANIC!

echo : prints user input.  `echo <any text string here>`

gen  : generate a new key document. message is optional. `gen [<message>]`

help : help information.

list : list all key documents.

peek : view details of a key document.  `peek <# from list>`

use  : designate currently used key document. `use <# from list>`

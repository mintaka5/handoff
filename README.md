# handoff

#### *a virtual interaction to create sufficient knowledge.*

What i'm trying to do with this one is create a programmatic model of a cellular wall's scaffold protien. To me it 
represents a **hand off**, and this is my colloquilism for knowledge transfer. It's passive as %&#^!, and chroincally 
nonetheless, but it's providing sufficient knowledge to all parties (i'll term `agents` in 
[battlement](https://github.com/white5moke/battlement)).

#### what can it do?

````
bye : exit the app.
cur : what is your current key document `cur`
del : deletes all your key documents. be careful! `del`
echo : prints user input. `echo <any text string here>`
gen : generate a new key document. message is optional. `gen [<message>]`
help : help information.
list : list all key documents. sorted by most recent first `list`
peek : view the details of a key document `peek <# from `list`>`
sign : signs a string of text, and produces signature. `sign <some silly text here>`
use : designate currently used key document. `use <# from `list`>`

# handoff

#### *a virtual interaction to create sufficient knowledge.*

What i'm trying to do with this one is create a programmatic model of a cellular wall's scaffold protien. To me it 
represents a **hand off**, and this is my colloquilism for knowledge transfer. It's passive as %&#^!, and chroincally 
nonetheless, but it's providing sufficient knowledge to all parties (i'll term `agents` in 
[battlement](https://github.com/white5moke/battlement)).

#### what can it do?
`cur  : what is your current key document`

`del  : deletes all your key documents. be careful!`

`echo : prints user input.  'echo <any text string here>'`

`gen  : generate a new key document.`

`help : help information.`

`list : list all key documents.`

`peek : view details of a key document.  'peek <# from list>'`

`use  : designate currently used key document. 'use <# from list>'`

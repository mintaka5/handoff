# handoff

#### *a virtual interaction to create sufficient knowledge.*

What i'm trying to do with this one is create a programmatic model of a cellular wall's scaffold protien. To me it represents a **hand off**, and this is my colloquilism for knowledge transfer. It's passive as %&#^!, and chroincally nonetheless, but it's providing sufficient knowledge to all parties (i'll term `agents`).
